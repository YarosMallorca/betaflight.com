It will leave most frequencies below the cutoff value intact but it will already attenuate the cutoff frequency by -3dB. The attenuation will increase with higher frequency.\nUnfortunately some setups are so noisy that the attenuation will not be enough and the filter cutoff has to be set very low to 70Hz or 60Hz simply to get rid of the noise above 200Hz.\nThis means that useful information between cutoff and 100Hz is lost.

Thanks Thomas.\nBoris' Answer:\nIf its just the bounce:\nYou could try lower p setpoint weight.\nBut you could also try test dterm setpoint of 0.\nSee if the above 2 can remove the need for more D.\nBut high D is not an issue at all if the motors dont heat up and if it all still sounds smooth.\nThomas' Reply:\nSet dterm setpoint to 0 and no bounce back at all.
