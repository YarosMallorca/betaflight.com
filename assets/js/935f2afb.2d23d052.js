Designed around the STM32F4 MCU, it features a simple layout that makes connecting components convenient and easy to accomplish. The FuryF4 utilizes an SPI gyro (MPU-6000 or ICM-20689) for super fast communication with the MCU. Flight logging can be easily done by writing to the onboard data flash or SDCard slot.","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/HAKRCF405":{"id":"support/boards/HAKRCF405","title":"HAKRCF405","description":"Hardware and Features","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/HAKRCF722":{"id":"support/boards/HAKRCF722","title":"HAKRCF722","description":"Hardware and Features","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/HAKRCF722D":{"id":"support/boards/HAKRCF722D","title":"Board - HAKRCF722D","description":"Hardware and Features","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/IFLIGHTF4_TWIN_G":{"id":"support/boards/IFLIGHTF4_TWIN_G","title":"IFlightF4_TWIN_G","description":"IFlightF4_TWIN_G : Real Twin Gyroscopes.","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/JHEF7DUAL":{"id":"support/boards/JHEF7DUAL","title":"JHEF7DUAL","description":"Features","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KAKUTEF3":{"id":"support/boards/KAKUTEF3","title":"KAKUTE F3","description":"Target Hex code: SPRACINGF3","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KAKUTEF4":{"id":"support/boards/KAKUTEF4","title":"KakuteF4-AIO","description":"Description","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KAKUTEF4V2":{"id":"support/boards/KAKUTEF4V2","title":"KAKUTEF4V2","description":"KAKUTE F4 FLIGHT CONTROLLER V2","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KAKUTEF7":{"id":"support/boards/KAKUTEF7","title":"KakuteF7","description":"Features","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KAKUTEH7":{"id":"support/boards/KAKUTEH7","title":"KakuteH7","description":"Description","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KAKUTEH7V2":{"id":"support/boards/KAKUTEH7V2","title":"KakuteH7V2","description":"Description","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KISSFC":{"id":"support/boards/KISSFC","title":"KISSFC","description":"Keep It Simple Stupid.","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KIWIF4":{"id":"support/boards/KIWIF4","title":"KIWI F4","description":"Description","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KIWIF4V2":{"id":"support/boards/KIWIF4V2","title":"KIWI F4 V2","description":"Flight Controller","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/KROOZX":{"id":"support/boards/KROOZX","title":"KROOZX","description":"Description","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/LUMBAF3":{"id":"support/boards/LUMBAF3","title":"LUMBAF3","description":"Affordable basic Flight Controller based on F3 and MPU-6000.","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/LUX_RACE":{"id":"support/boards/LUX_RACE","title":"LUX_RACE","description":"Description","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/LUXF4OSD":{"id":"support/boards/LUXF4OSD","title":"LUXF4OSD","description":"This is an AIO Flight Controller F4 FC with OSD and 30A BLHeli_32 ESC.","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/LUXMINIF7":{"id":"support/boards/LUXMINIF7","title":"Lux Mini F7","description":"Features","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/MATEKF405":{"id":"support/boards/MATEKF405","title":"MATEKSYS F405-STD","description":"Description","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/MATEKF405-CTR":{"id":"support/boards/MATEKF405-CTR","title":"Matek F405-CTR","description":"Full details on the Matek Sys F405-CTR can be found on the Matek Website MATEKF405","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/MATEKF411":{"id":"support/boards/MATEKF411","title":"MATEKSYS F411-MINI","description":"Matek F411-MINI","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/MATEKF722":{"id":"support/boards/MATEKF722","title":"MATEKSYS F722-OSD","description":"MATEKF722","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/MATEKF722-SE":{"id":"support/boards/MATEKF722-SE","title":"MATEKSYS F722-SE","description":"Full details on the MATEKSYS F722-SE can be found on the Matek Website MATEKF722SE","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/MATEKF722-STD":{"id":"support/boards/MATEKF722-STD","title":"MATEKSYS F722-STD","description":"Description","sidebar":"support"},"support/boards/MERAKRCF405":{"id":"support/boards/MERAKRCF405","title":"MERAKRCF405","description":"MERAKRCF405 flight control is carefully optimized layout, so that users can be more concise,convenient wiring,.For ensure a good flight experience ,we use of high-performance MPU6000 gyroscope.
